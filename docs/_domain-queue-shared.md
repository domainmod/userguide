The easiest option for adding domains is to use the Domain Queue, which allows you to supply a list of domains and let DomainMOD take care of the rest (and in some cases you don't even need to supply the list of domains, it will be automatically retrieved from your registrar account).

This option uses your domain registrar's API to retrieve information required to add domains, so unfortunately it only works if your registrar has an API and support for it has been built into DomainMOD. Before using this option make sure your API credentials have been saved with your registrar account.
