!!! danger "Warning"
    Before upgrading it's **strongly** recommended that you backup your DomainMOD installation directory and database. If something goes wrong during the upgrade there may be no way to recover your data, and having a backup of your installation directory and database will allow you to easily restore your previous version. 
    
    The Backup & Restore instructions can be found [here](backup-restore.md).

**Option #1 -- Docker Install**  
If you installed DomainMOD using Docker, please see our official DomainMOD container on Docker Hub for upgrade information: <https://hub.docker.com/r/domainmod/domainmod>

**Option #2 -- .zip File Install**  
If you installed DomainMOD by downloading the .zip file, visit the following URL to download the most up-to-date version: <https://domainmod.org/download/>

Once the download completes, upload and unpack the new archive overtop of where you installed the previous version (or unpack it and then upload it, whichever you prefer).

**Option #3 -- Git Install**  
If you installed DomainMOD using Git right from your web server, just run the following command from within your installation directory to upgrade:

    git pull

**Option #4 -- Softaculous Install**  
If you installed DomainMOD using Softaculous you're just a few clicks away from upgrading to the newest version. Please see the upgrade instructions on the Softaculous Wiki: <https://www.softaculous.com/docs/How_to_upgrade_installations>
