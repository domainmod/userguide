The CSV Importer allows you to import all of your domain data into DomainMOD using a CSV template. This is a brand new feature as of DomainMOD v4.19, but all testing has gone very well, and I've personally imported quite a few test CSV files with 100% accuracy. Keep in mind that the CSV Importer only imports **new** domains, it does not update domains that are already in your DomainMOD database.
